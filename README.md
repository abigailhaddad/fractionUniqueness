# uniquefractions

This is code for:

* Creating a graph showing 'fraction uniqueness', or the proportion of fractions that are uniquely identifiable from a decimal/percentage as a function of the maximum possible denominator and the number of digits/degree of rounding.

* Lets you input a numerator and denominator and tests to see how many possible other values there 
could be for various degrees of rounding, given a maximum possible denominator
